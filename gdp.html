            <u><em>Contribution to GDP</em></u><br>

            <br><em>What is GDP?</em><br>
            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a comprehensive measure of a country's overall economic activity. It represents the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, typically annually or quarterly. <br>
            
            <br><em>GDP Per Capita</em><br>
            This is GDP divided by the population of the country, giving an average economic output per person. It's a useful indicator for comparing economic performance between different countries or assessing the standard of living within a country.<br>

            <br><em>Importance of GDP</em><br>
            - Economic Performance: GDP is a primary indicator used to gauge the health of a country's economy. An increasing GDP indicates economic growth, while a decreasing GDP may signal economic trouble.<br>
            - Policy Making: Governments and central banks use GDP to design economic policies, including fiscal and monetary policies.<br>
            - International Comparison: GDP allows for comparison of economic productivity and living standards between countries.<br>
            
            <br>GDP is a crucial measure that helps understand the size, health, and growth rate of an economy, guiding economic decisions and policies.<br>

            <br>Tourism plays a significant role in Belize's economy, contributing substantially to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The following points outline how tourism impacts Belize's GDP:<br>

            <br><em>Direct Contributions:</em><br>
            Accommodation and Hospitality: Revenue from hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other hospitality services.<br>
            Transportation: Income from airlines, car rentals, tour operators, and local transportation services.<br>
            Attractions and Activities: Earnings from entrance fees to national parks, archaeological sites, and marine reserves, along with guided tours and recreational activities such as diving and snorkeling.<br>

            <br><em>Indirect Contributions:</em><br>
            Supply Chain: Purchases made by hotels and restaurants from local suppliers, such as food and beverages, construction materials, and other goods and services.<br>
            Employment: Jobs created in sectors directly and indirectly related to tourism, including hotel staff, tour guides, transport operators, and local artisans.<br>
            
            <br><em>Induced Contributions:</em><br>            
            Spending by Employees: Wages paid to employees in the tourism sector lead to increased spending in the local economy on goods and services such as housing, education, and healthcare.<br>
            
            <br><em>Foreign Exchange Earnings:</em><br>            
            International Visitors: Spending by international tourists brings foreign currency into the country, helping to balance the trade deficit and stabilize the local currency.<br>
            
            <br><em>Infrastructure Development:<br></em>
            
            Investment: Tourism often drives investment in infrastructure such as roads, airports, and utilities, which benefits the broader economy.<br>
            
            <br><em>Government Revenue:<br></em>
            
            Taxes and Fees: Tourism generates significant government revenue through taxes on income, sales, property, and specific levies on tourism-related activities and services.<br>
            
            <br><em>Statistical Contributions<br></em>
            According to data from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), tourism accounted for approximately 41.3% of Belize's total GDP in 2017.
            The sector also provided around 37.1% of total employment in the same year, indicating its critical role in job creation.<br>

            <br><em>Economic Diversification<br></em>
            Tourism helps diversify Belize's economy, which traditionally relies heavily on agriculture and fishing. This diversification makes the economy more resilient to sector-specific shocks.<br>

            <br><em>Sustainable Development<br></em>
            Emphasis on eco-tourism and sustainable practices helps protect Belize's natural resources, which are a significant draw for tourists. This sustainable approach ensures that tourism can continue to be a major economic driver without degrading the environment.<br>

            <br><b>Tourism is a cornerstone of Belize's economy, with wide-ranging contributions to GDP through direct spending, job creation, and investment in infrastructure, along with significant indirect and induced economic effects.</b>

            <u><em>History & Origin Of Tourism</em></u><br>
                Because Belize was not an independent country prior to 1981, it was not considered an international tourism destination although the industry has its fledgling origins in the 1960s. The biggest early issue was the lack of infrastructure to accommodate tourism on a significant scale. <br><br>
                Belize’s government and civil population have looked at the success of other countries in the region, namely Costa Rica and Mexico, and wanted to do the same. Knowing Belize has similar resources to these other countries along with some unique advantages of its own, they set out to establish and promote a thriving tourism industry in the country. The goal has always been to do this in a sustainable manner so Belize’s natural resources and local identities will be preserved. <br><br>
                Tourism really began taking off in 1985 and has grown exponentially ever since. The global recession in 2008 hit Belize harder than the rest of the Caribbean, but recovery has been stronger. Natural disasters and, more recently, climate change, remain significant threats to the sustainability of Belize’s tourism industry. <br><br>

            <br><u><em>Timeline</em></u><br>
                <em>Introduction to Hospitality</em><br>
                Accommodations in Belize were made available for visitors as early recorded in 1860's. Before that, visitors had to stay in home with locals.<br><br>
                
                Hotel Monte Carlo, the Union Hotel, the International
                Hotel, Belisle’s Hotel, Wagner’s Hotel and Brewers’s
                Hotel were accepting visitors. <br><br>
                
                Around these times, prices for accommodation ranged from $1.50-$2.00 per day. <br><br>
                

                <em>Introduction to Tour Guiding</em><br>
                Jaguar hunting was one of the first tours offered in Belize in the 1950s. To book a tour, guests would communicate with guides using letters in the mail. <br><br>

                "Safari" tourism in Belize soon shifted into a product that focused on visits to Maya temples and the forests of the country. This was encouraged by companies like S&L Tours ran by Lascelle and Sarita Tillet. Thus, by the early 1960s, guides were pricing tours around their dinner table at night, and taking out overland tours by day.<br><br>


                <em>1st Government Investment</em><br>
                The first institutional investment in tourism was the Fort George Hotel (Radission Fort George Hotel present day) which was developed by the Colonial Government in 1953. This hotel was built because British officials visiting Belize to evaluate projects could not find proper lodging. <br><br>

                After the Fort George, one of the first hotels catering to experiential tourism was Barothy’s Caribbean Lodge. This was a camp opened by Vic Barothy , an American immigrant who was the first to prove the concept that it was feasible to earn substantial money by catering to visitors seeking to experience <br><br>


                <em>1st Water Taxi (1980s) </em><br>
                As the industry developed, locals like David Gegg entered the
                business around 1972. Gegg got his start in the business when he met some tourists on a flight from the US to Belize. The following day, Gegg took the tourists water skiing. Gegg started Discovery Expeditions soon after and pioneered the water taxi business with “Don Pedro” as the first vessel ferrying tourists from the mainland to San Pedro. <br><br>


                <em>1st Eco Lodge </em><br>
                In 1977, Mick and Lucy Fleming, a British couple, moved to Belize and started a family farm on the Macal River, upriver from San Ignacio. The Flemings then decided to create Belize’s first jungle lodge which they called Chaa Creek Eco Lodge. Business was brisk and the infrastructure was
                upgraded in 1990. Their Blue Morpho Butterfly Breeding Centre
                and the Natural History Centre were added in 1997. 

                
                <em>1st Tourism Boom </em>
                1996 Naturalight Production, a company created by Tony and Therese Rath provided an online platform to help with promoting tourism sectors in Belize. Introduction of online marketing targeted American and Canadian visitors.<br><br>

                The second boom occurred in 2001 when the Belize Tourism Village was opened to allow cruise tourism. In 2019, Belize welcomed a total of 503,177 overnight visitors. This represents more than 100% growth in the sector in the past decade (up from 241,119 in 2010).<br><br>

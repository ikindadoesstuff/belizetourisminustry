            Belize’s tourism sector has experienced impressive growth in recent years, with double-digit annual growth rates in overnight tourist arrivals since 2016. <br>
            
            <br> - Belize’s tourism industry is still considered an “emerging” sector rather than a “mature” one, especially when compared to long-established Caribbean destinations. <br>
            <br> - Investments by major international hotels and planned development projects, including a multi-million dollar cruise port off the coast of Belize City, contribute significantly to economic activity.  <br>
            <br> - Employment Opportunities: The tourism industry generates employment opportunities for thousands of people in Belize. Hotels, restaurants, tour operators, and related businesses directly contribute to job creation, helping reduce unemployment rates and alleviate poverty.  <br>
            <br> - In 2019, travel and tourism contributed to employment for approximately 63,400 persons in Belize. <br>
            <br> - Policy and Sustainability: To guide the sector’s development from 2012 to 2030, Belize’s government endorsed a National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan (NSTMP) in 2011. The plan outlines initiatives and targets for both the immediate and medium terms. <br>
            <br> - Sustaining tourism growth involves accelerating structural reforms, fortifying governance frameworks, reducing crime, mitigating natural disaster impacts. <br>
